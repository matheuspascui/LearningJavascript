# READ ME

In this Repository, I will be uploading my own JavaScript Cheat Sheets. <br>
They are not cheat sheets as others found in the internet, because I have been building this as source of usefull contents and to remember somethings that I may forget. <br>
Since they are way different than the Cheat Sheets found in the web, I don't know if they would be able to help someone else, but, if they have helped at least one person, I would be glad that id did!

The examples and 'timeline' of the contents are not from 1 course individually, rather than a compilation of contents and resumes from various YouTube Courses along with "Dev.to" and "Medium" articles.

In the `All_JavaScript_Basics.md`, I try to compile the minimum ammount of JavaScript I would have to know in order to learn Node, Express, React and so on. Basic JavaScript, go there.

For an Introduction to React, I was following the "Programming with Mosh" video about React and was taking some notes and writing some reminders for myself. 

:exclamation: OBS: all the present files will be updated as I progress on the courses and take more notes.

That's all, folks!
